8 bit Microcontroller developed at CI Brasil

EMC08 project is an 8-bit Microcontroller internal IP that could be used in future projects that require, embedded DIGITAL, AMS, RF and DSP blocks as part of the automotive system application.

The 8-bit Microcontroller has a CPU optimized for control applications, extensive Boolean processing capabilities, 4K bytes of on-chip program memory (ROM) address space, 128 bytes of on-chip data RAM, 32 bidirectional and 8 unidirectional and individually addressable I/O lines, three 24-bit timer/counters, full-duplex UART, vector interrupt structure with two priority levels.
